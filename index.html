        <p class="texto b">
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may 
          lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
          Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. 
          Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

          Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific 
          groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be 
          beneficial to use.
